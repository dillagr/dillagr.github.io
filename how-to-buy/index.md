## _FAQ: How to Buy a Helium Hotspot/Miner?_
If you want to buy a hotspot/miner, here's how..

**WARNING! Before buying a miner, make sure it is compatible with your regional LoraWan frequency.**

First off, allow me tell you why I chose the Linxdot Helium Miner. Since I reside in the Philippines, the Linxdot supports the Lora frequency of AS923-3. And the other clinching factor is the Instant-Sync. While other miners take 2-3 days to sync to the blockchain, the Linxdot can do it in less than an hour!

Another significant factor is they will ship the hotspot/miner to my address. This is very convenient in my honest opinion. **And in my experience they will ship it for FREE!**

In doing your research, you will confirm and verify that there are a limited number of hotspots that ship directly to the Philippines. And worst, even more limited support for AS923-3.

## **_DISCLAIMER_**
I am not working for Linxdot nor have relatives who work for the company. I have created this guide since I personally bought their product and am currently waiting for them to ship the hotspot to me.

If this guide has helped you in any way and you want to show appreciation for the assistance, buy me coffee by sending some crypto.
